### JEST and Enzyme combination

Simple click counter app wrapped with tests

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
